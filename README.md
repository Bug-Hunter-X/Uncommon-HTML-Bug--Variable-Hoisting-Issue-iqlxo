This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to variable hoisting differences between 'let' and 'var' in older JavaScript environments. The bug is caused by using 'let' when 'var' is expected.

The bug.html file shows the problematic code. The solution.html file demonstrates the corrected code using 'var'.
